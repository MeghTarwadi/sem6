# Question 1

### S22

#### (a)What is meant by Software and Software Engineering? 03

- Software is a collection of programs which are needed to achive desired features, functionalities with high perfomance.
- Software has two types 1. Generic (developed to serve multiple applications) 2.Custom(developed to serve one application).
- Software engineering is a disipline, method and techniques to develop a software
- To develop software efficiently software engineer is needed
- Through Software engineering one can develop software efficiently and in less time and resources.

#### (b)Discuss merits and demerits of Waterfall model. 04

- There are 6 major phases
  - **Requirements Gathering**: Identify customer needs and requirements through techniques such as interviews, surveys, and observations.
  - **Analysis**: Analyze the requirements to identify any inconsistencies or conflicts.
  - **Design**: Develop a preliminary design that meets the customer's requirements.
  - **Implementation**: Implement the design and develop working software.
  - **Testing**: Test the software to ensure it meets the required standards.
  - **Deployment**: Deploy the software to production.
  - **Maintanance**: Maintain the software
- Linear Sequential model Advantage
  - Simple to implemet
  - easy to understand
  - best for small software development
- Linear Sequential model Disadvantages
  - making changes are hard
  - only at the end customer can have a look at the product till than cant do anything.
  - All previous stages are needed to achive current stage hence working on multiple stages isnt possible.

#### (c)What is the importance of Process Model in development of Software System? Discuss Spiral Model in detail. 07

- Process model is a representation of process in order to develope software in abstract formate.
- It demonstrates life cycle of a software development.
- Its needed inorder to
  - **Improved quality**: To deliver high-quality software that meets user expectations.
  - **Increased efficiency**: By streamlining processes and reducing rework.
  - **Better risk management**: To minimize errors, delays, and costs associated with project changes.
  - **Enhanced collaboration**: To facilitate effective communication among team members and stakeholders.
- **Spiral Mode**
  ![Image Alt Spiral_Mode](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4H263KIaul8/UPR2v8NhyeI/AAAAAAAABDc/xKJzCIk4Ea0/s1600/software_engineering_13.png)
- The Spiral Model is an iterative development approach in Software Engineering (SE) that combines the strengths of both Waterfall and Agile methodologies. This model involves a phased approach to project management, where each phase consists of a series of iterations.
- This is an incremental method in version of software
- Its suited for large scale projects
- There are 6 major phases
  - **Requirements Gathering**: Identify customer needs and requirements through techniques such as interviews, surveys, and observations.
  - **Analysis**: Analyze the requirements to identify any inconsistencies or conflicts.
  - **Design**: Develop a preliminary design that meets the customer's requirements.
  - **Implementation**: Implement the design and develop working software.
  - **Testing**: Test the software to ensure it meets the required standards.
  - **Deployment**: Deploy the software to production.
  - **Review and Retrospective**: Review the project's progress, identify areas for improvement, and plan for future iterations.
- Advantages
  - The changes are easy to made in each stage
  - Easy to debug
  - Clients will be aware about the feel and functions of software.
  - Breaks large project into smaller chunks
- Disadvantage
  - Costly and Time consuming
  - Since its Customer Communication based approach if communication isnt done properly the software developement may result in faliur.
- When to choose Spiral Model
  - The requirements arent clear
  - The software it too large
  - The errors are expected minimul / highly robust
  - Budget isnt an problem
  - Prototypes of software are needed

### S23

#### (a)What is Software Engineering? Justify Software is Engineered but not Manufactured 03 (RE)

- Justification of Software is Engineered but not Manufactured
  - **Lack of Physical Constraints**: Unlike manufactured goods, software has no physical constraints that affect its design or functionality. This freedom allows developers to focus on creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly products without being bound by material limitations.
  - **Dynamic Nature**: Software is dynamic, meaning it can be easily modified, updated, or replaced as technology evolves or user needs change. In contrast, manufactured goods have a fixed product life cycle, with limited opportunities for modification after production.

#### (b)What is Process? Discuss the process framework activities. 04

- In software engineering, a process is a structured approach to managing and delivering software products.
- There are 6 process framework activities
  - **Requirements Gathering**
  - **Analysis**
  - **Design**
  - **Implementation**
  - **Testing**
  - **Deployment**
  - **Review and Retrospective**

#### (c)Explain Spiral Process Model and states its advantages and disadvantages. 07 (RE)

### S24

#### (a)Describe software engineering as a layered technology. 03

- Any software can be developed in these layered approach
  1. Quality Management layer
  2. Processes layer
  3. Methods layer
  4. Tools layer
- First the quality of software is estimated based on requirements tha the poper process is being decided based on given time and budget than the required methods such as requirements gathering, analysis,designing etc are conducted and finally the software is tested in with various tools in order to find bugs and errors in softtware.

#### (b)Describe various umbrella activities in software development. 04

![Image Alt Umbrella activities](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240528113139/umbrella-activity.webp)

- Umbrella activities
  - **Software Project Tracking and Control** This activity allows the software team to check the progress of software development.
  - **Formal Technical Reviews** Remove errors before they are propagated to the next activity.
  - **Software Quality Assurance** The quality of the software, such as user experience, performance, workload flexibility, etc., must be tested and verified after reaching the specified milestones, which reduces the tasks at the end of the development process.
  - **SCM or Software configuration management** It manages the impact of changes throughout the software development process.
  - **Document Preparation and Production** activities required to create work products such as models, documents, logs, forms, and lists.
  - **Re-usability Management** Defines the development of components that can be reused as different widget.
  - **Measurement and Metrics** Define process, project, and product metrics to help the team deliver software that meets the needs of stakeholders.
  - **Risk Management** Series of steps to help manage uncertainty.

#### (c)Discuss spiral model with diagram and compare it with waterfall model. 07

| goes through each phase more than 1 time   | goes through each phase for 1 time only |
| Prototypes are available though each cycle | No prototypes are to be made            |
| Better suited for large software           | Better suited for small software        |

#### (a)Why Spiral Process Model is also known as Meta Model? 03

- The spiral model is not restricted to a fixed number of development phases. Instead, it supports different sets of phases.
- May be required for different projects, based on the complexity and application of the software/product.
- In a single iteration, these are the six phases:
  - **Requirements Gathering**
  - **Analysis**
  - **Design**
  - **Implementation**
  - **Testing**
  - **Deployment**
  - **Review and Retrospective**
